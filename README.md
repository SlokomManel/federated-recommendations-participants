# Welcome to Federated Recommendations 👋

Thank you for participating in this research study! This app helps us build better recommendations **while keeping your privacy intact**.

## How it works (in plain English)

📺 **Your Netflix history stays private** — we never send your raw viewing data anywhere. Everything runs locally on your machine.

🔄 **You help train a shared model** — instead of sending your data to a server, you help improve a recommendation model that all participants share. The aggregator only sees small, anonymized updates (not your data).

📱 **You get personalized recommendations** — the app uses the shared model plus your local viewing history to recommend movies and shows.
